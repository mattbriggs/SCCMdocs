# Task sequence action variables in System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*

Task sequence action variables specify configuration settings that are used by a single step in a System Center Configuration Manager task sequence. By default, the settings used by a task sequence step are initialized before the step is run and available only while the associated task sequence step is run. In other words, the task sequence variable setting is added to the task sequence environment before the task sequence step is run, and the value is removed from the task sequence environment after the task sequence step has run.  

## Action Variable Example  
 For example, you can specify a start-in directory for a command-line action by using the **Run Command Line** task sequence step. This step includes a **Start In** property whose default value is stored in the task sequence environment as the **WorkingDirectory** variable. The **WorkingDirectory** environment variable is initialized before the **Run Command Line** task sequence action is run. During the **Run Command Line** step, the **WorkingDirectory** value can be accessed through the **Start In** property. Then after the task sequence step is completed, the value of the **WorkingDirectory** variable is removed from the task sequence environment. If the sequence contains another **Run Command Line** task sequence step, the new **WorkingDirectory** variable is initialized and set to the starting value for that task sequence step.  

 Whereas the default value for a task sequence action setting is present while the task sequence step is run, any new value that you set can be used by multiple steps in the sequence. If you use one of the task sequence variable creation methods to override a built-in variable value, the new value remains in the environment and overrides the default value for other steps in the task sequence. In the previous example, if a **Set Task Sequence Variable** step is added as the first step of the task sequence and sets the **WorkingDirectory** environment variable to the value **C:\\**, both **Run Command Line** steps in the task sequence will use the new starting directory value.  

## Action Variables for Task Sequence Actions  
 Configuration Manager task sequence variables are grouped by their associated task sequence action. Use the following links to gather information about the action variables associated with a specific action. The task sequence variables govern how the task sequence action operates. The task sequence action reads and uses the variables that you mark as input variables. Alternatively, you can use the Set Task Sequence Variable action or the TSEnvironment COM object to set the variables at runtime. Only the task sequence action marks variables as output variables, which are read by actions that occur later in the task sequence.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Not all task sequence actions are associated with a set of task sequence variables. For example, although there are variables associated with the Enable BitLocker action, there are no variables associated with the Disable BitLocker action.
